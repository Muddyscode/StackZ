Built for Nigeria’s youth, StackZ tackles economic challenges with low-capital side hustles (e.g., POS Business, Social Media Management) and intuitive budgeting tools. Its neon aesthetic and gamification (badges, notifications, sound effects) make finance fun, while local storage ensures offline use on low-spec devices (e.g., 4GB RAM laptops).
